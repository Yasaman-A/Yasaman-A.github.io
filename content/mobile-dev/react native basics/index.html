        <p>In this activity, you will practice your react native knowledge by creating a single screen mobile application. You will create your mobile application and store your code in your Github.</p>
<p><strong>Submission format </strong>- You will work individually on this task and include your code in your github repository. You will invite your instructor to your github repository to review your work.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated time</strong>: 2 hours</p>
<p><strong>Submission deadline</strong>: Oct. 21</p>

        <h2 is-upgraded>Accounts and installations </h2>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>You will use Github in this activity. Create a repository in your Github account. </li>
<li>You will create your application using Expo. Make sure that you have Expo Cli installed on your computer. Follow the project creation instructions posted earlier to create a project.</li>
</ol>
<h2 is-upgraded>Create a repository and set the permissions</h2>
<ol type="1" start="3">
<li>Create a <strong>private</strong> repository in Github. Name your repository as â€˜GPA calculator&#39;. </li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="4">
<li>Please include your full name in your github account or in the readme file of your repository.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="5">
<li>Give access to your instructor (Github username: Yasaman-A) to review your repository. </li>
</ol>
<h2 is-upgraded>Readings and practices before you start</h2>
<ol type="1" start="6">
<li>Make sure to read the following sections from React Native documentation: <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started" target="_blank">https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started</a>: 1) Introduction, 2) Core and native components, 3) React fundamentals.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="7">
<li>Make sure to review the code samples we completed in class.</li>
</ol>

        <ol type="1" start="8">
<li>You will create a single screen (one page) GPA calculator that shows the name of 3 courses, e.g., course 1, course 2, and course 3. The user can enter a grade out of 100 for each course. When the user enters the grade, the letter grade will be calculated and shown on the page for each course. </li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="9">
<li>When the user clicks on the calculate button, the application will calculate the average of the grades entered as the GPA (assuming that all grades have the same weight and credit). When the average is calculated, it will be shown on the screen.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="10">
<li>Design your code using two components: Course component that represents a course and a calculate component that does your calculations.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="11">
<li>Please test the application with different possible user inputs. Your application should not crash with any input that the user is allowed to enter in the application. You can test it on your phone, or emulators/simulators, or you may use Expo Snack (<a href="https://snack.expo.io/" target="_blank">https://snack.expo.io/</a>) to test the output of your application online.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="12">
<li>A sample design is provided below. This design is based on the components of react-native-paper: <a href="https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/" target="_blank">https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/</a>. You may choose to use a different library or style your own components. Your final design does not have to look exactly the same as the provided sample.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 241.50px" src="img/65b998aacc937968.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="13">
<li>After you finish writing the code, use Eslinter locally to check the style of your code, and fix the identified style issues.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="14">
<li>Push your changes to your Github repository. You may use any branch for this exercise. Make sure to have a workflow that checks your code style and the workflow runs successfully when you push your code.</li>
