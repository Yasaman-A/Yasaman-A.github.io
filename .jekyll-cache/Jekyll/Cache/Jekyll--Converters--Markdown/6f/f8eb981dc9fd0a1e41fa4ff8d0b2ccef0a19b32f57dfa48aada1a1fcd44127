I"á<p>Machine learning has shown a great potential in healthcare applications. However, in some cases the use of these techniques are limited due to the unavailabilty of structured data. 
Free human expression in the form of natural language is a primary form of communication in clinical settings. While this can be convenient for medical record keeping, this format is not ideal for machine learning models. Natural language processing (NLP) has the potential to accelerate translation of cancer treatments from the laboratory to the clinic and will be a powerful tool in the era of personalized medicine. This technology can harvest important clinical variables trapped in the free-text narratives within electronic medical records.</p>
