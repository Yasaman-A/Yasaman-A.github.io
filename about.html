            I am a Software Engineer an Assistant Professor at Mount Royal University. I have received my PhD in
            Software Engineering from University of Calgary on

            My journey of academic career started from Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT) in Tehran where I got
            selected as a top undergraduate student in Computer Information Technology program and was offered to start
            my MSc education at AUT in 2008. During my research at AUT I had the privilege to work under the supervision
            of Dr. Mohammad Kazem Akbari in a research team which was following a visionary research plan in the area of
            emerging computing technologies. My research topic was in the context of pervasive computing which is now
            known as the Internet of Things.

            I started my PhD studies in Calgary where the weather always reminds me of my hometown! My 4 years of PhD
            studies at the University of Calgary was full of new experiences, learning, and growing. I worked in the
            area of machine learning and cloud computing under the supervision of Dr. Behrouz Far and Dr. Diwakar
            Krishanmurhty. Working for a year as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Calgary was an
            opportunity for me to learn about new areas in computing while enjoying the support of many great people
            around me during my career transition. In 2018, I started as an assistant professor at Mount Royal
            University and I am enjoying the combination of teaching and research in my career.

            I deeply care about the practical and hands-on aspects of the computing field. To gain hands-on experience
            in my field, I started working in industry when I was in the 4th year of my undergraduate studies. I started
            working as a software developer in a team that helped me to connect the learnings from my courses to
            real-life solutions. After learning more about the software engineering career path, I moved
            to a software tester role, as my next career. In this role, I worked with a higly motivated and ambitious
            team buidling automated solutions for testing the functionality of highly sensitive financial services. The
            creativity and the novelty involved in my day-to-day work motivated me to start my PhD research in the area
            of software testing. My PhD research, helped me to expanded my knowledge of software testing and quality
            assurance and focus on the performance aspect of large scale applications. I worked on the performance
            analysis of cloud-based services and big data applications. My current projects involves building, testing,
            and modeling distributed machine learning and data analytics applications.
